This work lead to the identification of the first clinically useful compound lovastatin(mevinolin)  from a mould in the mid 1970's. This agent was first used in the more severe forms of hypercholesteraemia in the 1980s followed by landmark trials  with simvastatin that showed the potential for cardio-prevention. Cerivastatin was withdrawn in 2001 because of a ten times higher incidence of rhabdomyolysis than the other statins.  \n",

              "4     Hypotension is the term for low blood pressure (BP). A systolic BP measuring less than 90mmHg and/ or diastolic BP of less than 60mmHg is considered hypotension. A difference of 20 mmHg systolic BP and 10 mmHg diastolic BP is considered orthostatic hypotension (OH). Orthostatic hypotension is the most common type of hypotension, and neurogenic hypotension is demonstrated among 1/3rd of the individuals with OH. A decrease in blood pressure can be life-threatening in conditions such as anaphylaxis and addisonian crisis, and requires prompt treatment. It is important to access the possibility of head injury in a patient with syncope due to hypotension. ECG is an important and essential component of the evaluation of hypotension. Shock requires prompt management with fluids and vasopressors. For other causes of hypotension, identifying the cause and treatment is the best strategy. Lifestyle modifications are usually the first step in management. Medications causing a drop in blood pressure should be discontinued or changed to an appropriate alternative.  \n",

If small and asymptomatic, no treatment is necessary. Larger, symptomatic cases of Zenker's diverticulum have been traditionally treated by neck surgery to resect the diverticulum and incise the cricopharyngeus muscle. However, in recent times non-surgical endoscopic techniques have gained more importance, and the currently preferred treatment is the endoscopic stapling i.e. closing of the diverticulum via a stapler inserted through a tube in the mouth. This may be performed through a fiberoptic endoscope. Other non-surgical treatment modalities exist, such as endoscopic laser, which recent evidence suggests it less effective than stapling.\\nThere are no established measures for the primary prevention of Zenker's Diverticulum.  \n",

Orthostatic hypotension is the most common type of hypotension, and neurogenic hypotension is demonstrated among 1/3rd of the individuals with OH. A decrease in blood pressure can be life-threatening in conditions such as anaphylaxis and addisonian crisis, and requires prompt treatment. It is important to access the possibility of head injury in a patient with syncope due to hypotension. ECG is an important and essential component of the evaluation of hypotension. Shock requires prompt management with fluids and vasopressors. For other causes of hypotension, identifying the cause and treatment is the best strategy.

If small and asymptomatic, no treatment is necessary. Larger, symptomatic cases of Zenker's diverticulum have been traditionally treated by neck surgery to resect the diverticulum and incise the cricopharyngeus muscle. However, in recent times non-surgical endoscopic techniques have gained more importance, and the currently preferred treatment is the endoscopic stapling i.e. closing of the diverticulum via a stapler inserted through a tube in the mouth. This may be performed through a fiberoptic endoscope. Other non-surgical treatment modalities exist, such as endoscopic laser, which recent evidence suggests it less effective than stapling.\\nThere are no established measures for the primary prevention of Zenker's Diverticulum.</td>\n",
